        p bBot alpha is in active development.
        p We'll be streamlining our docs and developer tools for writing, deploying and interacting with bBot instances as a matter of priority.
        p For now, the quickest way to get started is to start a new local project, import bBot and start chatting in the command line.

          p 1. bBot is a #[a(href="npmjs.com/package/bbot") Node.js package], so it requires #[a(href="https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm") Node and NPM]
          p 2. Start a new project with #[code npm init]
          p 3. Install bBot as a dependency with #[code npm install --save bbot]
          p 4. Create an #[strong index.js] file as per example below
          p 5. Run the bot with #[code node index.js]

            |
