## Executable Examples

To execute examples directly from the bBot mono-repo, start by cloning it and
running the setup script which will install and link local dependencies, then
compile the bBot source.

```shell
âžœ git clone https://github.com/amazebot/bbot
âžœ cd bbot
âžœ npm run setup
```

Now you can run any of the examples using the example script followed by the
folder name of the example. e.g.

```shell
âžœ npm run example branches-basic
```
